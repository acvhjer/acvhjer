#About me

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Gromov-Witten Theory and Quantum Cohomology
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding to do some symbolic computation
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on symbolic computationw with certain given constriants
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about math behind the theory
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email on homepage
- âš¡ Fun fact: A famous math joke goes like this: The Axiom of Choice is obviously ture, the Well-Ordering Principal is obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn's lemma?
